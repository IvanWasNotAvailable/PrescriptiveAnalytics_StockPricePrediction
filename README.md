# PrescriptiveAnalytics_StockPricePrediction

## Introduction
This implementation is a project carried out as part of the Prescriptive Analytics class at the University of West Florida, under the guidance of Dr. Burch. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the application of Twitter sentiment analysis as a powerful tool for predicting stock prices. By leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project explores the relationship between public sentiment on Twitter and stock market trends.

The implementation showcases a step-by-step process of collecting historical stock market data and associated Twitter data from different time periods. The tweets are associated with the corresponding stock chart to examine the correlation between Twitter sentiment and stock price movements. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in the tweets and comparing it with the historical stock data, this project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of using Twitter sentiment analysis as a tool for predicting stock prices.
